... and I said ``YES``!
=======================

This could be the final sentence at a movie, political speach or even just
another simple positive statement.

Nevertheless, this is !yes what this repositoryabout.

This repository is just a collection of different
implementations of the ``yes`` GNU utility in different programing languages of
my choosing.

Also, this is based out of this quite `nice article <https://matthias-endler.de/2017/yes/>`_ by Mathias Endler.
